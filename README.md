**Tic Tac Toe**
This is my beginner project, a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a basic two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with X's or O's.

This is my beginner project, a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a basic two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with X's or O's.

Features
Two-player mode: Local play between two users.
Responsive Design: Built with HTML and CSS for a clean and adaptable UI.
JavaScript Logic: Handles game flow, win conditions, and tie detection.

**How to Play :**
Player 1 uses 'X' and Player 2 uses 'O'.
Players alternate turns, placing their mark in any empty cell on the grid.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
The game results in a tie if all cells are filled and there’s no winner.

**Technologies Used :**
HTML: For structuring the game layout.
CSS: For styling and making the game visually appealing.
JavaScript: For handling game logic and interactions.
